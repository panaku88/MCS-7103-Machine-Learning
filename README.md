MCS 7103: Machine Learning 

Assignment 1: Exploratory Data Analysis Process
Based on last week's lecture, your assignment is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis 
Process (DAP) on your dataset and write a report that is at least 3 pages long. You can 
write as many pages as you need. The report needs to be clear and follow a step-by-step 
process.

1. Present your question before and after, then the answers. The answers can be 
before the next step (Data Wrangling), every process or after the full process. The 
question that helped you select the dataset should differ from the questions you 
are using for the rest of the process. I have general questions to guide you 
through your analysis.
2. Perform in-depth data wrangling.
3. Provide a well-detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
4. Draw some conclusions based on the performed EDA.
5. Communicate the Ô¨Åndings in a detailed report.
